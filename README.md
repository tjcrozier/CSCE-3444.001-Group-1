# Echo Code — AI-Assisted Python Debugging for Visually Impaired Programmers

**Echo Code** is a Visual Studio Code extension that combines **AI-powered code tutoring** with **audible Python error reporting**. Designed to assist **visually impaired students**, this tool reads out Python errors detected by **Pylint**, provides inline code annotations, and offers an interactive chat tutor that analyzes your active file to answer questions and provide exercises.

---

## **Features**

- **Automatic Python Error Detection**  
  Automatically detects errors using Pylint when a Python file is saved.

- **Reads Critical Errors Aloud**  
  Uses text-to-speech to read only essential errors (e.g., syntax errors, undefined variables).

- **Output Panel Logging**  
  Displays all detected errors in the VS Code Output Panel for visual reference.

- **Simplified Error Messages**  
  Provides clear, concise explanations without overwhelming beginners.

- **Summarize Functions, Programs, and Classes**  
  Automatically generates brief summaries for programs along with individual functions and classes using AI, delivered via text-to-speech (TTS).

- **AI Code Tutoring Annotations**  
  Provides inline annotations explaining **common coding mistakes** and suggesting improvements.

  - 🆕 New functions for generating big O(n) annotations

- **Interactive Chat Tutor**  
  An AI-powered tutor that reads your active file and answers questions or provides exercises specific to its content. Open it with `Ctrl+Alt+C` and ask about your code directly.

- **Voice Input for Tutor Chat**  
  Use your microphone to ask questions instead of typing them. Trigger voice input with a shortcut or mic button in the chat panel.

- **Auto-Detection of Missing Tools**  
  Automatically prompts users to install **Pylint** if it’s not found.

- **Function Navigation via Hotkeys**  
  Use **Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down Arrow** to navigate between function definitions, with automatic speech announcing the current function.
- **Assignment Tracker System**  
  Allows blind users to upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` assignment files and uses AI to extract clear task lists:

  - Tasks are read aloud one-by-one.
  - Tasks can be marked complete with a hotkey.
  - Tasks are saved to a file and displayed in the output panel.

- **Integration with GitHub Copilot**  
  Leverages GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat for enhanced AI-powered coding assistance.

- **Line Reader**
  Allows the user to see what is put on the line exactly and generate a brief summary that also checks for issues

- **Character Reader**
  Alerts the user to what key is being pressed while typing and alerts to where their cursor is.

- Non-critical errors (e.g., missing docstrings) are logged but not read aloud.
- Currently only works on Windows machines.
- When generating code summaries, multiple TTS triggers may overlap.
- Large files might exceed the language model’s token limit in the chat tutor; responses may truncate.
- Speech to text is not functional right now
